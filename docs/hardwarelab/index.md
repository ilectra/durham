The HPC Hardware Lab @Durham provides Durham and UK researchers with access to cutting edge technologies and facilities.
It is hosted within, yet independent of the [COSMA HPC facility](https://cosma.readthedocs.io) and receives funding from Durham University, industry partners, UKRI (e.g. through ExCALIBUR) and DiRAC.

Information about how to [access the HPC Hardward Lab](access.md) and associated testbed installations is described [on a dedicated access page](access.md). We appreciate the help of colleagues to keep these pages up-to-date and consistent, and to add any missing information. Please follow the process described on the [contribution](contribute.md) pages.

## Further information

A lot of information about the Durham HPC Hardware Lab is hosted by the [COSMA HPC documentation](https://cosma.readthedocs.io/en/latest/hardwarelab.html).


A list of [historical hardware](historic.md) (now retired) is maintained.
